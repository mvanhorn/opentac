"""What the back silkscreen says: a taxel-core QR, and a registration grid.

`silk_label` puts the design name on the front, inboard of the connector, so a
fabricated board says which design it is. This is the other half of the same
problem: a board that has been separated from its manifest entirely.

Two marks, and they answer different questions.

The QR carries the taxel core (see `export/taxel_core.py`): grid dimensions,
both pitches, the grid origin, taxel size, the interdigitated footprint
parameters, the connector pad number for every row and column net, the
active-taxel mask, and the pad-order permutation. That is typically under 100
bytes, which is a QR small enough to print, and it is everything needed to
read a sensor -- the scan order, where each taxel physically sits, and which
pad drives it.

It prints as a link, HTTPS://OPENTAC.GITHUB.IO/Q/<payload> (taxel_core.qr_link),
so a phone camera opens the website's decoder page. The link is 28 characters
longer than the payload, which usually costs one QR version, 1.4 mm a side
per version. A board too small for it gets the bare payload,
which a phone shows as text for the decoder page or `opentac manifest
from-qr`; a board too small for that gets no QR.

The grid carries the board's shape, by making the photograph measurable. The
outline is deliberately not in the QR (it is 80-95% of the payload, and the
physical board already has it), so it comes from a picture instead. A flex
sensor is the hard case: it is almost never flat when photographed, so a
single scale factor -- or four corner fiducials -- recovers the outline wrong
exactly where the board curves. A grid samples the whole surface, so the photo
can be unwarped locally.

The grid sits on the manifest coordinate frame with its origin at (0, 0), not
on the board's bounding box, so an intersection read off a photo is a taxel
coordinate. That is most of the value and it costs nothing.

Mirroring. Back-layer artwork is stored in board (top-view) coordinates in
both KiCad and Gerber; the fab mirrors it at production. So anything here
appears mirrored when you look at the physical back. The two marks want
opposite things about that:

  * The QR is chiral. A mirrored QR is rejected by most decoders, so it is
    pre-mirrored about its own centre and therefore reads correctly off the
    physical back. In a top-view editor it looks backwards, as intended.

  * The grid must not be mirrored. A grid line at x = 10 mm is physically at
    x = 10 mm; seeing it flipped from the back is a fact about which side you
    are standing on, not an error to correct. Mirroring it would make the
    printed coordinates disagree with the board's real geometry.

The origin L-marker discloses the handedness, so a pipeline reading a back
photo can detect the flip and account for it.

Sizing is pinned to JLCPCB's flex silkscreen rules, which are the binding
constraint (they are the same as their rigid limits; flex silkscreen is not a
special order):

    line width      >= 0.15 mm hard, 0.20 mm recommended
    hollow gap      >  0.25 mm   -- and a knocked-out QR is a hollow feature
    auto-widening   lines under the minimum are silently widened, which would
                    destroy the pre-compensation below without any warning

At MODULE_MM = 0.35 with PRECOMP_MM = 0.05 the thinnest ink feature is 0.25 mm
and the smallest knockout is 0.45 mm, which clears every recommended limit.
0.30 mm sits exactly on the recommended ink minimum; 0.25 mm sits on the hard
one, where auto-widening lives.

Polarity. Silkscreen is light ink on dark coverlay, so drawing ink where the QR
is dark produces an inverted code, and decoder support for those is
inconsistent. The ink is therefore the light field and the dark modules are
knocked out as bare coverlay, giving an ordinary dark-on-light code. KiCad
unions overlapping silk and cannot subtract, so that knockout is built as
horizontal runs of ink rather than as "rectangle minus modules".

Pre-compensation. Screen printing spreads ink by a roughly fixed amount, which
eats the knockouts. Shrinking the ink by that amount at design time cancels it
-- ordinary screen-print practice, and worth about 2x in tolerable spread.
PRECOMP_MM, the amount removed from every ink edge, is an estimate of that
spread rather than a value calibrated on fabricated boards.
