    The wiring keep-out is a variable-width band that follows the outline's own
    shape (see pipeline/keepout.py) — widest where wires pile up on their way to
    the tail, hugging the real edge where few pass. Pixels reaching into that
    band are simply never packed, so nothing is deleted after the fact.

    The band's width depends on the row/column net counts, which depend on the
    packing, which depends on the band. That fixed point is resolved by
    iterating with an element-wise max: widths only ever grow, so the inner loop
    cannot oscillate and is guaranteed to terminate.

    That ratchet alone, though, finds the *greatest* fixed point reachable from
    wherever it started rather than the tightest one, and the result depends on
    the starting width in a way that is backwards: a narrower start packs a
    denser first iteration, whose row count inflates the modelled demand, and
    np.maximum can never give that width back. Measured on a 70x50 board,
    starting at 1.0mm converged to a profile 3.80mm wide holding 131 pixels,
    while starting at 3.0mm converged to 3.00mm holding 135 — the narrower start
    produced the wider band. So the ratchet is wrapped in a relaxation loop:
    once it converges, the demand is recomputed from the layout that actually
    resulted (which needs less room than the transient dense one that set the
    width), the band is allowed to drop to it, and the ratchet runs again. Every
    converged candidate is scored and the densest is returned, so this can only
    ever match or beat the single-pass result.

    Returns (layout, profile, info). (The hug router does NOT use this — see
    layout_fixed_hug_keepout: its exact plan-driven demand needs no fixed
    point, and this ratchet death-spirals with joined nets.)
