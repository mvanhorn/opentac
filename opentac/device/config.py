"""Manifest -> DeviceConfig: the bytes a readout board stores to know its skin.

The board needs only what it takes to scan: array size, which connector line
each row and column reaches, which taxels exist, the pitch, and which taxels
share a shear bump. Everything else in the manifest stays on the computer.
The byte layout is documented in firmware/opentac_readout/ot_devcfg.h; this is
the only other place that knows it.

Which line a manifest pad reaches belongs to the readout board, not the skin,
so it lives in one data file per board (boards/*.json) and every skin goes
through it.
